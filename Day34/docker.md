# Docker Overview, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to package your application along with all its dependencies into a single unit called a **container**.

A container is a lightweight, standalone environment that includes:

- The application code  
- Required libraries and tools  
- System-level configurations  

This ensures that your app runs exactly the same across different machines — whether it’s your laptop, a server, or a teammate’s PC.

**Example:**  
If you build a web app using Node.js on your computer and share the Docker container, someone else can run it without needing to install Node or set up anything manually.

## What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a plain text script that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker container.

It tells Docker:

- Which base image to start with (like Node, Python, etc.)  
- Where to set the working directory  
- What files to copy into the container  
- How to install required dependencies  
- How to run the application  

### Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]

To build the image using this Dockerfile, run:


docker build .
Docker reads the instructions and creates a container image accordingly.

What is Docker Compose?
In many real-world applications, you need multiple containers working together. For example:

A backend application (Node.js, Django, etc.)

A database service (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)

Instead of running each container separately, Docker Compose lets you define and manage all your containers in a single file called docker-compose.yml.

Example docker-compose.yml

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

  db:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
To start all services together, use the command:

docker-compose up

This brings up the entire application stack in one go and simplifies managing multi-container setups.


You can now paste this into any Markdown editor or `.md` file. It will render perfectly in GitHub, VS Code, or any Markdown viewer.

Would you like me to export this as a downloadable `.md` file too?
