This HTML file demonstrates the difference between Flexbox and Grid layout systems in CSS.
It showcases multiple configurations of justify-content and align-items using Flexbox for horizontal and vertical alignment.
The Grid section illustrates column and row control with special classes for spanning (.big, .tall).
Color-coded sections make layout behavior easy to visualize: pink for flex containers, lightgreen for grid.
Useful for beginners exploring layout techniques and responsive design fundamentals.
