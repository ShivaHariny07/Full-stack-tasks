This HTML file demonstrates CSS Grid layout using grid-column and grid-row.

The grid has 4 columns and 2 rows with a 20px gap.

grid-column: 2/4 spans block 1 across columns 2 and 3.

grid-row: 1/3 makes block 2 span two rows.

grid-column: 3/8 in block 3 exceeds the defined grid and may cause overflow.
