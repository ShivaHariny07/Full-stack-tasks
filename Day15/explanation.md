**SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**

Server-Side Rendering is a web development approach where the server processes and generates the complete HTML for a page on each request. This fully constructed page is then sent to the client's browser, allowing for immediate content display and enhanced search engine indexing.

**Characteristics:**
* Page content is pre-built on the server.
* The browser receives ready-to-render HTML.
* **Applications:** News websites, blogs, e-commerce homepages, and applications requiring strong SEO or fast initial load times.
* **Frameworks:** Next.js, WordPress.

**CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**

Client-Side Rendering involves the server sending a minimal HTML shell and JavaScript instructions to the browser. The browser then executes the JavaScript to fetch data and dynamically build the page's content, constructing the Document Object Model (DOM) directly on the client side.

**Characteristics:**
* Browser performs page construction.
* Initial load delivers primarily JavaScript.
* **Applications:** Highly interactive web applications, dashboards, and complex user interfaces where dynamic content updates are frequent.
* **Frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular.

**SPA (Single Page Application)**

A Single Page Application functions by loading all necessary resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) once upon initial access. Subsequent user interactions, such as navigating or clicking links, trigger only partial content updates within the existing page, rather than a full page reload. This results in a fluid and continuous user experience.

**Characteristics:**
* Minimal full page reloads.
* Seamless transitions between views.
* **Applications:** Email clients (e.g., Gmail), social media platforms, and online productivity tools.

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**

SQL databases are characterized by their structured, tabular data model. Data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns, with predefined schemas enforcing data integrity and relationships. SQL is the standard language for managing and querying this type of relational data.

**Characteristics:**
* Strict schema with tables (rows and columns).
* Optimized for structured, relational data.
* **Use Cases:** Storing customer records, financial transactions, or inventory management where data consistency and relationships are critical.
* **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL.

**NoSQL (Not Only SQL)**

NoSQL databases represent a diverse category of non-relational data stores designed for flexible schema and horizontal scalability. They are optimized for handling large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data that does not fit neatly into traditional tabular formats.

**Characteristics:**
* Flexible schema; various data models (e.g., document, key-value, graph).
* Optimized for unstructured or semi-structured data.
* **Use Cases:** Storing chat messages, social media content, real-time analytics, or large datasets with evolving requirements.
* **Examples:** MongoDB, Firebase, CouchDB.

**History API**

The History API is a browser-side JavaScript interface that allows web applications to programmatically manipulate the browser's session history. It enables developers to change the URL in the address bar, add new entries to the browser's history stack, and respond to browser navigation actions (like back/forward button clicks) without initiating a full page reload. This functionality is crucial for creating robust Single Page Applications that maintain perceivable navigation and shareable URLs.
