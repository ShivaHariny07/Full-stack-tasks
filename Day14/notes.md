Difference Between a Library and a Framework

1. Control Flow:

Library: You call the library functions when needed. You are in control.

Framework: The framework calls your code at specific points. It is in control. This is known as Inversion of Control.

2. Usage Style:

Library: Acts like a toolset. You pick and choose what you want to use.

Framework: Acts like a skeleton. You build your application by filling in the structure it provides.

3. Flexibility:

Library: More flexible. You can use it in many ways with fewer restrictions.

Framework: Less flexible. You must follow its rules and patterns.

4. Examples:

Library: NumPy (Python), jQuery (JavaScript)

Framework: Django (Python), Angular (JavaScript)

Summary:

A library helps you, but you control the flow.
A framework guides you, but it controls the flow.
